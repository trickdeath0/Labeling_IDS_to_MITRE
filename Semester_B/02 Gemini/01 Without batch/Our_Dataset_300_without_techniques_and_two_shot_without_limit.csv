     Q: You are an information security expert. Your task is to label IDS rules for MITER ATT&CK techniques based on your cybersecurity knowledge. For the task, you are going to get a single Snort IDS rule and you will need to return the most relevant techniques from MITER ATT&CK that are related to the rule.
         Try to search based on keywords and based on the knowledge you have. For each technique include the following information as JSON in this order: ""Sid"", ""Technique ID"", ""Technique Name"", ""Quotes"", 
         Note: The value of the citation field should contain quotation marks from the data sets relevant to the mapped technique are the main reason you chose this technique to be correct. The value of the explanation should be your explanation of why you decided to give the technique and how it relates to the rule. The technique ID should be the official MITER technique ID.
         Please don't write anything but the JSON.
