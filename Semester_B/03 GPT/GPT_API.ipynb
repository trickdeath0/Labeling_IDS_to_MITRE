Now we will test your knowledge labeling IDS rules for MITRE ATT&CK techniques. For your task, you're going to have a single Snort IDS rule and you'll need to label the most relevant techniques from MITRE ATT&CK associated with the rule. From the rule you receive, your labeling should be based on your knowledge and the information found within the 'msg' in the rule received. For each technique you call the rule, include the following information as JSON format in this order: 'Sid', 'Technique ID', 'Technique Name', 'Quotes', 'Explanation'.  Note: The value of the 'Quotes' field should contain quotation marks from the data sets relevant to the mapped technique.
