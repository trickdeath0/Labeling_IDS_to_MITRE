T1491,Defacement,"Adversaries may modify visual content available internally or externally to an enterprise network, thus affecting the integrity of the original content"
T1491.001,Internal Defacement,"An adversary may deface systems internal to an organization in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users, thus discrediting the integrity of the systems"
T1491.002,External Defacement,"An adversary may deface systems external to an organization in an attempt to deliver messaging, intimidate, or otherwise mislead an organization or users"
T1561,Disk Wipe,Adversaries may wipe or corrupt raw disk data on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources
T1561.001,Disk Content Wipe,Adversaries may erase the contents of storage devices on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources
T1561.002,Disk Structure Wipe,Adversaries may corrupt or wipe the disk data structures on a hard drive necessary to boot a system; targeting specific critical systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources
T1499,Endpoint Denial of Service,Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users
T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,Adversaries may launch a denial of service (DoS) attack targeting an endpoint's operating system (OS)
T1499.002,Service Exhaustion Flood,Adversaries may target the different network services provided by systems to conduct a denial of service (DoS)
T1499.003,Application Exhaustion Flood,"Adversaries may target resource intensive features of applications to cause a denial of service (DoS), denying availability to those applications"
T1499.004,Application or System Exploitation,Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities that can cause an application or system to crash and deny availability to users
T1657,Financial Theft,"Adversaries may steal monetary resources from targets through extortion, social engineering, technical theft, or other methods aimed at their own financial gain at the expense of the availability of these resources for victims"
T1495,Firmware Corruption,"Adversaries may overwrite or corrupt the flash memory contents of system BIOS or other firmware in devices attached to a system in order to render them inoperable or unable to boot, thus denying the availability to use the devices and/or the system"
T1490,Inhibit System Recovery,Adversaries may delete or remove built-in data and turn off services designed to aid in the recovery of a corrupted system to prevent recovery
T1498,Network Denial of Service,Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users
T1498.001,Direct Network Flood,Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by directly sending a high-volume of network traffic to a target
T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target
T1496,Resource Hijacking,"Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems to complete resource-intensive tasks, which may impact system and/or hosted service availability"
T1489,Service Stop,Adversaries may stop or disable services on a system to render those services unavailable to legitimate users
T1529,System Shutdown/Reboot,"Adversaries may shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access to, or aid in the destruction of, those systems"
