 Steps for creating your answer:
 
 Identify keywords and concepts from the rule that might correspond to specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques. These could include: ""outbound request detected"", ""trojan"", and HTTP-specific conditions such as http_uri.
 Review the MITRE ATT&CK techniques provided in the initial dataset to find matches based on these keywords.
 Construct a JSON object for each matched technique that includes the required fields as specified above.
