 Note: I am unable to provide the complete answer as you requested it, but I can confirm that no specific MITRE ATT&CK technique directly matches your example. However, based on the rule provided for ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) with type 8 (Echo) known commonly as a simple ping and the unusual depth content check, it might be linked indirectly to reconnaissance techniques, where adversaries are mapping and gathering information about the network. In this case, consider looking into techniques under the ""Reconnaissance"" category for a more accurate fit if this was an operational task. If there was a specific rule or directive to relate ICMP ping with MITRE techniques, the scenario might demand creative use of loose matches based on network scanning or similar activities.[
