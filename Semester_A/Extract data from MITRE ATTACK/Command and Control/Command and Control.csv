T1568.001,Fast Flux DNS,Adversaries may use Fast Flux DNS to hide a command and control channel behind an array of rapidly changing IP addresses linked to a single domain resolution
T1568.002,Domain Generation Algorithms,Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains
T1568.003,DNS Calculation,"Adversaries may perform calculations on addresses returned in DNS results to determine which port and IP address to use for command and control, rather than relying on a predetermined port number or the actual returned IP address"
T1573,Encrypted Channel,Adversaries may employ a known encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol
T1573.001,Symmetric Cryptography,Adversaries may employ a known symmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol
T1573.002,Asymmetric Cryptography,Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol
T1008,Fallback Channels,Adversaries may use fallback or alternate communication channels if the primary channel is compromised or inaccessible in order to maintain reliable command and control and to avoid data transfer thresholds
T1105,Ingress Tool Transfer,Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment
T1104,Multi-Stage Channels,Adversaries may create multiple stages for command and control that are employed under different conditions or for certain functions
T1095,Non-Application Layer Protocol,Adversaries may use an OSI non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network
T1571,Non-Standard Port,Adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port pairing that are typically not associated
T1572,Protocol Tunneling,Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim system within a separate protocol to avoid detection/network filtering and/or enable access to otherwise unreachable systems
T1090,Proxy,Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure
T1090.001,Internal Proxy,Adversaries may use an internal proxy to direct command and control traffic between two or more systems in a compromised environment
T1090.002,External Proxy,Adversaries may use an external proxy to act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure
T1090.003,Multi-hop Proxy,"To disguise the source of malicious traffic, adversaries may chain together multiple proxies"
T1090.004,Domain Fronting,Adversaries may take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and other services which host multiple domains to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic or traffic tunneled through HTTPS
T1219,Remote Access Software,An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks
T1205,Traffic Signaling,Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control
T1205.001,Port Knocking,Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control
T1205.002,Socket Filters,Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control
T1102,Web Service,"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying data to/from a compromised system"
T1102.001,Dead Drop Resolver,"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to host information that points to additional command and control (C2) infrastructure"
