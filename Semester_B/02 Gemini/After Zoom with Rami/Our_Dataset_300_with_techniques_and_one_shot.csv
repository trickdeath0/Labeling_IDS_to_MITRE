 Q: You are an information security expert. Your task is to label IDS rules for MITRE ATT&CK techniques based on your cybersecurity knowledge. For the task, you are going to get a single Suricata IDS rule and you will need to return the most relevant techniques from MITRE ATT&CK that are related to the rule.
     Try to search based on keywords and based on the knowledge you have. For each technique include the following information: 'Sid', 'Technique ID', 'Technique Name', 'Quotes', 'Explanation'
     Note: The explanation can contain quotations from the data sets relevant to the mapped technique if it is the main reason you chose this technique to be correct. The explanation should be your explanation of why you decided to give the technique and how it relates to the rule. The technique ID should be the official MITRE technique ID.
     Please don't write anything but the JSON.
